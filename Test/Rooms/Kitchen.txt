Kitchen
You enter a kitchen of modest size for such a dungeon. Near the pantry stands a skeleton. It could be an adversary, a biology class room teaching aid, or left overs from the previous meal. All of a sudden you hear an other-worldly whisper and the skeleton begins to walk towards you. It's time to kick ass and chew bubblegum, and you're all out of bubblegum.
You take a big frying pan from the stove and hit the skeleton on the head. A critical hit, as the skeleton falls apart into a big pile of bones.
The skeleton seems to be moving quite slowly however. You stroll towards the door at the end of the kitchen at a leisurely pace while humming: 'The thigh bones connected to the, hip bone...'.
You pour a beer for the skeleton and hand it over to the white fellow. As you cheerfully toast, you drink your health potion. The Skeleton seems happy to have had some company and returns to the pantry. You go through the door at the end of the kitchen.
