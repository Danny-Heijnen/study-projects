You enter a large dining room. At the table is a vampire that enjoys a glass of... probably not red wine.
You smile warmly at the fanged foe. Your radiant personality shines forth and the pale figure in front of you slowly crumbles to ashes.
You smile warmly at the fanged foe. It is however not fooled by your friendly facade. The dungeon-dwelling duke of darkness shifts into the guise of a bat and flies forth to bite your tasty neck. It manages to sink its fangs into your flesh, you bat the flying mammal away and beeline it for the nearest door out of this dangerous place.
You challenge the vampire to a rap battle and start to spit some lines. Your opponent almost succumbs to the instant awkwardness, turns into a bat and flies away. You flee the room unharmed, but with less street cred than 2 minutes ago.
You challenge the vampire to a rap battle and start to spit some lines. Your opponent is surprisingly hip hop-savvy and disses your mom like there's no tomorrow. You flee the room in tears, your ego severely wounded.
