Bedroom
You enter a large bedroom. In the corner lies a where-wolf. No, no, no, not a werewolf, a where-wolf. It looks at you puzzled with a tilted head as if to ask where you are from. Then it gets up starts to walk in your general direction.
You walk towards the where-wolf and pose the following riddle: Who knows where Willem Wever lives? The where-wolf becomes even more confused and tilts his head some more. A he tilts his head, you hear a dry snap and the wolf falls down.
You dart past the where-wolf to the other end of the room and before his jaws can clamp down on your adventurous behind, you quickly close the door behind you, leaving the wolf to wonder where you might go next.
You use a health potion and quickly walk to the end of the room.
