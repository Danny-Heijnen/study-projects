You enter a large bedroom. In the corner stands a creepy puppet. It starts to move in your general direction.
You slash at the puppet with your sword and cleave it in twin.
You dart past the puppet to the other end of the room and quickly close the door behind you.
You use a health potion and shove the doll away from you. The doll falls down and you quickly go through the door and close it behind you.
