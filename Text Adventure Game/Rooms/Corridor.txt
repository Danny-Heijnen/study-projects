Corridor
You enter a long corridor. At the end of the corridor you see a ghoul that's gnawing away at what appears to be a large bone.
You run at the ghoul and roundhouse kick it. The ghoul lets out a grunt and falls to the ground. You make a Chuck Norris joke as the ghoul laughs and lets out his last breath.

Your kick misses the ghoul and you hit the wall of the corridor, hurting your foot. Since the ghoul hasn't noticed you at all, you simply walk through the door at the end of the corridor.
You run at the ghoul, make a football slide past it and go through the door at the end of the corridor. The ghoul seems confused and continues his usual routine.
