Dining Room
You enter a large dining room. At the table is a vampire that enjoys a glass of... probably not red wine.
You smile warmly at the fanged foe. Your radiant personality shines forth and the pale figure in front of you slowly crumbles to ashes.
You challenge the vampire to a rap battle and start to spit some lines. Your opponent almost succumbs to the instant awkwardness, turns into a bat and flies away. You flee the room unharmed, but with less street cred than 2 minutes ago.
You pull out a health potion, salute your fellow bar mate and quaff the life-giving red liquid.
