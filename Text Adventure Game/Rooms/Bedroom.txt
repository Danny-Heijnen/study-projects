Bedroom
You enter a large bedroom. In the corner you see a small dragon. The dragon hisses, breathes out a puff of smoke and stares at you.
You hit the dragon with your sword. It lets out a last puff of smoke and that is the end of the dragon.
You try to hit the dragon with your sword. Your swing is too large, it sees the attack coming and breathes fire in your general direction. You get hit by the fire, but also manage to slay the dragon.
You try to flee from the dragon and succeed as you quickly close the door behind you.
You misjudged the length of the dragon's neck. As you run past, it bites your leg. You do however manage to get away and close the door behind you.
