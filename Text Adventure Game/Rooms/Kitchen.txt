Kitchen
You enter a kitchen of modest size for such a dungeon. Near the pantry stands a skeleton. It could be an adversary, a biology class room teaching aid, or left overs from the previous meal. All of a sudden you hear an other-worldly whisper and the skeleton begins to walk towards you. It's time to kick ass and chew bubblegum, and you're all out of bubblegum.
You take a big frying pan from the stove and hit the skeleton on the head. A critical hit, as the skeleton falls apart into a big pile of bones.
You take a big fying pan from the stove and try to hit the skeleton on the head. It has seen this trick before, so it deftly moves out of the way of the pan and bites you in your shoulder.

The skeleton seems to be moving slowly. As you stroll towards the door at the end of the kitchen at a leisurely pace, the skeleton jumps forward and grabs you by the ankle as you try to close the door behind you. The heavy wooden door hits your leg. You kick your foot loose from the skeleton's grasp and close the door.
