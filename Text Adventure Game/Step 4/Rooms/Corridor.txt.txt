You enter a long corridor. At the end of the corridor you see a ghoul that's gnawing away at what appears to be a large bone.
You run at the ghoul and roundhouse kick it. The ghoul lets out a grunt and falls to the ground. You make a Chuck Norris joke as the ghoul laughs and lets out his last breath.
You run at the ghoul, make a football slide past it and go through the door at the end of the corridor. The ghoul seems confused and continues his usual routine.
You drink one of your health potions and try to sneak past the ghoul. The ghoul is so fixated on the bone that he doesn't notice your presence. You sneeze, the ghoul looks up and you quickly go through the door as if nothing happened.
